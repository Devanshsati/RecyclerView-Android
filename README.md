- **Horizontal List**: Demonstrates a horizontal list using a linear layout manager.
- **Staggered Grid**: Displays items in a staggered grid layout with three columns.

### Item Representation
- Each item in the RecyclerView comprises:
  - **Image**: Represents the restaurant visually.
  - **Name**: Displays the name of the restaurant.
  - **Address**: Shows the location or address of the restaurant.
